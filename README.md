Here are the instructions to set up the web app:

Step 1: I used Visual Studio Code as my code editor for this project. First, download and install VS Code. To do this, type 'Visual Studio Code' into your web browser and enter the web site 'code.visualstudio.com'. Then, click 'Download' to download VS Code.

Step 2: Now, import the project files into VS Code. Open the VS Code and make sure that the explorer section is open on the left side. Then, find the folder which contains project files in the computer directory. Next, drag and drop this folder into the space on the left side of the VS Code to open it there. You should be able to view the folder and all the files inside it. Alternatively, 

Step 3: Then, check if Node.js is available in your computer. This can be done by typing 'node -v' command into the terminal. If the terminal does not appear below, click on the 'Terminal' section in the upper left corner and click 'New Terminal'. If Node.js exists in your computer with the latest version, proceed to next step, otherwise download Node.js by going to 'nodejs.org' in your web browser and clicking on the left green button which downloads the most stable version of Node.js recommended for most users. 

Step 4: Next, install the packages required for this project. Right click on the 'App Back End' folder in VS Code and select 'Open in Integrated Terminal' option. This should open a new terminal with a path to this folder. Next, type 'npm init -y' command into the terminal. This should create a package.json file in the 'App Back End' folder. Then, type 'npm install express' command to install express. This should also create a package-lock.json file. After that, type 'npm install mysql2' command to install mysql2, type 'npm install dotenv' command to install dotenv and type 'npm install cors' command to install cors. Finally, nodemon needs to be installed globally or locally. To install nodemon globally, type 'npm install -g nodemon' command. To install nodemon locally, type 'npm install nodemon --save-dev' command. If nodemon does not install, you can skip installing nodemon since 'npx nodemon' command can be used to start nodemon later. After installing all the packages, a 'node_modules' folder should be created. If this folder is not created, open up the project folder in the computer directory. Then, drag and drop the 'node_modules' folder into the 'App Back End' folder opened in VS Code.

Step 5:
